# Covid_Canada_Shiny_Dashboard
Practicing using Shiny by using a covid API for Canadian cases.

The dashboard uses data from the api: https://covid19api.com/. 

Data displays Canadian covid cases by province and can be downloaded in a .csv format. Data can be filtered by province, year, and month. 

There are graphs that show the growth trend of covid cases by province. Provinces can be filtered.
